                    <p>Sparked by the Day Spa shootings in March 2021, conversations about 'Asian Hate', aka anti-Asian discrimination, have become more prominent in the American consciousness. However, a lot of this conversation on non-Asian folks' end has stopped at 'raising awareness' via sharing articles and links to charities.</p>

                    <p>But Stopping Asian Hate requires more than that. To truly fight racism, you need to be deconstructing racist structures in the world <i>and</i> in your mind, then replacing them with something better. It's constant work, and you need to be honest with yourself about your current biases so you can address them.</p>

                    <p>The stories we're told and the tropes they use are highly influential in ingraining racial biases in people. The word trope is defined on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">tvtropes.org</a> as "a storytelling shorthand for a concept that the audience will recognize and understand instantly (…) a plot trick, a setup, a narrative structure, a character type, a linguistic idiom…you know it when you see it."</p>

                    <p>In this series, I will go over specific biases demonstrated in media tropes depicting Asia and Asian folks (focusing predominately on East Asia, as I'm East Asian). Many are obviously othering, like Yellowface (ex: the cab driver in Breakfast at Tiffany's), but many are relatively subtle, like the Asian Airhead (ex: London Tipton in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody). Tropes describe trends that appear across many stories; while a single story's depiction might only be slightly problematic, multiple stories with a similar depiction can form an ultimately racist trope.</p>

                    <p>I will break down the series into four topics, one per week. Each Sunday, I will break down the current week's topic; in the following six days, I will give tropes that are manifestations of that topic. Please note that Asian discrimination is complex; a single trope will likely be a manifestation of several different topics, but one might fit better than others.</p>

                    <p>The four topics you can look forward to are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>May 2: Orientalism
                        <li>May 9: Yellow Peril</li>
                        <li>May 16: Sexual tropes</li>
                        <li>May 23: Perpetual Foreigner</li>
                    </ul>
                    There will be a few days of reflection at the end of the month.</p>

                    <p>Orientalism as an oppressive tool (as opposed to simply an area of academic study, or any depiction of Asian countries) was most prominently defined in Edward Said's book, Orientalism, in 1978. In a nutshell, it is “the way that the West perceives of — and thereby defines — the East".</p>
                    
                    <p>The East, also called the Orient, is defined as anything east of Europe and Eurocentric culture, i.e. the West. This includes a lot of places, such as the Near/Middle East (aka West Asia), South Asia, and East Asia, but for this series, I'm going to be mostly focusing on East Asia, as I'm East Asian.</p>
                    
                    <p>Little tidbit: the word for 'China' in Chinese is <i>Zhōngguó</i>, which translates to Middle Kingdom. Yet it's part of the Far East in Western terminology, named only for its location in relation to Europe. This is the crux of Orientalism: the East only exists as a concept created by (literal) Eurocentric thought, warped through White supremacist views of the Other. The West is defined as normal and standard, with strengths and weaknesses that are inherently human. The East is defined as deviant from that norm, with strange powers and exotic customs, inherently <i>in</i>human.</p>
                    
                    <p>Orientalism is a broad umbrella under which a lot of anti-Asian racism falls. However, in this series, I will be specifically defining it like this:</p>

                    <blockquote><b>Orientalism - </b> Western interpretations of native Asian cultures and people as an exotic and mysterious Other.</blockquote>

                    <p>For this week, I will be discussing tropes that are interpretations of Asia itself, including the people, cultures, and religions within it.</p>

                    <p>Whatever it is, it's obviously stereotypical and inaccurate, but - why is Asia depicted like this in the first place?</p>
                    
                    <p>To make a long history overly-short: Spurred by the accounts of merchants, curiosity about their colonial outposts, and heaping piles of racial fetishization, European artists and scholars in the past several centuries became enamored with the Asia they thought they knew.</p>
                    
                    <p>This manifested in the artistic movement of Orientalism, with specific movements like <i>chinoiserie</i> and <i>Japonism</i>, picking and choosing elements of Asian dress, art, architecture, and culture that fit European aesthetic sensibilities. While a lot of beautiful art has been created as part of these movements - for example, chinoiserie and the rococco period - they're still products of an unequal power dynamic between Western colonizers and the colonized.</p>
                    
                    <p>This dynamic can be seen in the portrayal of Asia in contrast to the West: more decadent, less civil, more mystical, less powerful, more sexual, less moral. They also portray Asia as stuck in an archaic past, with the West firmly in the present.</p>
                    
                    <p>You usually (<i>usually</i>) don't see this trope played straight (i.e., as per usual, without acknowledgement, subversion, or deconstruction of its racism) anymore, at least when it comes to depictions of actual Asia. However, the trope has persisted in many fantasy/alternate universe stories and settings. It's just so cool and exotic you know?</p>

                    <p>This Asia is dirty, grimy, and dangerous. The dust of the desert sand - or maybe the choking heat of the humid jungle? - infects men's hearts and makes them conniving and violent.</p>

                    <p>In these modern depictions of Southeast Asia, you will find only ramshackle huts and war-torn villages, begging prostitutes and rough-faced men who will kill you with the flick of a balisong or the pull of a trigger. These poor, overpopulated cities live in squalor and disrepair, with heartless guerilla fighters smuggling drugs and guns to a despondent populace.</p>

                    <p>In these modern depictions of West Asia (as opposed to the fanastical Arabian Nights version described in my previous post), you will find only white stone buildings with bulbous roofs in lavish cities, submissive girls with black veils and bushy-bearded men who will kill you with the swing of a scimitar or the pull of a trigger. These oil-rich, overpopulated lands live in the chains of religious law, with heartless  terrorists smuggling drugs and guns to a bowing populace.</p>

                    <p>The West sees these portrayals as more realistic, more accurate to the terrors of the foreign East. Almost never does it ask how these regions might've gotten this way - I mean, who's been supplying those guns in the first place? Whose wars ravaged those countries? Who's buying all that oil...?</p>

                    <p>Ehh, who cares.</p>
