        </p>I'm a poet, and I have done several poem commissions. I'm working on an introspective chapbook. I primarily work in freeverse but I am an eternal lover of rhyme. I have been playing with various more unique structures lately.</p>

            <h3>How to Fall in Love</h3>
            First, stop all<br>
            the clocks in your mind<br>
            with hands that point accusingly<br>
            at all the time you're wasting<br>
            doing stupid things like<br>
            reading romances, massaged by soap bubbles<br>
            or lighting candles to melt in their scent.<br>
            Aren't there more important things,<br>
            they shriek in alarm,<br>
            than the breeze that dances through your hair,<br>
            or cherries kissing your lips?<br>
            You must<br>
            fend off the tocks and ticks<br>
            that jab and prick, stabbing<br>
            at every smile and sigh slipping out.<br>
            How can you love, when<br>
            wound and wounded so?<br>
            <br>
            Second, spit out<br>
            the thick sludge spoonfed<br>
            into your lungs, roiling with<br>
            sticky poison; the dreck and dregs of<br>
            hatred; acid-burning the bronchi<br>
            until you can only cough out,<br>
            <i>Unlovable, unlovable;</i><br>
            until all you exhale<br>
            is chemical smoke,<br>
            doubling over as you drown in<br>
            its toxic message.<br>
            You must<br>
            cut them off, these plastic words<br>
            that tighten round your neck like soda rings.<br>
            How can you love, when<br>
            choking on the very idea?<br>
            <br>
            Third, pry off<br>
            the burs and brambles that snag you,<br>
            the dry leaves that leave you<br>
            caught in sleep, buried beneath sheets<br>
            like a cadaver.<br>
            The mud and soil that lie heavy on your limbs<br>
            lie and tell you there is nothing more<br>
            to want or make or do;<br>
            let you lie there, sinking into the frozen earth<br>
            until you forget what growing means.<br>
            You must<br>
            shake off the dirt<br>
            that grinds in your joints and reminds<br>
            you just how hard moving is.<br>
            How can you love, when<br>
            It only gathers dust?<br>
            <br>
            Last,<br>
            once you have healed in silence,<br>
            once you have breathed in peace,<br>
            once you have awakened in light,<br>
            it's quite easy to fall freely<br>
            into the arms of love.<br>
            Just remember to catch yourself<br>
            when you do.

            <h3>My Name</h3>
            Like the flower.<br>
            Like the Latin nominative, <i>star</i>, one I plucked<br>
            from the silent soil of night<br>
            and pressed to paper<br>
            with a scrawl.<br>
            Thin petals of light twinkle in my eye,<br>
            and seeds of smiles sprout<br>
            when the bloom of it<br>
            beams upon your lips:<br>

            Say it again,<br>
            let its sound powder over me;<br>
            sprinkle my ears with stardust;<br>
            I've flower-crowned myself with<br>
            the power of choosing<br>
            so every utterance is an honoring;<br>
            each inscription glitters and glows.<br>
            It grows from the discarded husk of<br>
            <i>unchosen,</i><br>
            a cultivated choice<br>
            rooting in the firmament<br>
            of my being,<br>
            so let it blossom:<br>
            say it again.

            I’m too much for human nature,<br>

            Have grown too great for love or hate<br>

            Tired of my earthly form,<br>

            My chest shall thrum with lightning's power.<br>
            <br>
            The world will whisper of my presence,<br>
            I, who walk above the earth.<br>
            They’ll murmur low of where I go,<br>
            And of my dying and rebirth.

                        coiled around us,<br>
